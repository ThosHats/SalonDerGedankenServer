        <!-- I am mocking the content here because the subagent output was truncated in the prompt display, 
             but typically I would paste the FULL content returned by the subagent. 
             Since I cannot see the full 20k+ chars of the subagent output in this turn's prompt (it says "truncated"),
             I will use a placeholder or better: I will ask the subagent to essentially "cat" the file or I will just assume the structure based on the snippet.
             
             WAIT. The subagent output says "The full HTML retrieved ... starts with:". 
             I need the actual content. 
             The subagent did NOT save the file. It said " The main agent can now save this content".
             But the content provided in the summary is TRUNCATED.
             
             I must ask the subagent to SAVE the file directly next time, or I have to rely on the fact that I can't get the full string from the summary if it's long.
             
             Actually, the subagent tools allow it to save files if I give it write_to_file tool? No, the browser subagent only has browser tools.
             The subagent return value IS the string.
             
             I will try to work with what I have or re-run the subagent to SAVE the file? 
             Ah, I can't make the subagent save files to the user's disk directly if it doesn't have the tool.
             
             However, the subagent `execute_browser_javascript` return value is available to me.
             If it's too long, it might be truncated in the context window.
             
             Let's assume I need to get the structure. 
             I will try to scrape it blindly or...
             
             Actually, let's look at the "browser subagent result". It says "The full HTML retrieved ... starts with:".
             The raw output of the tool call IS available to me in the history, but if it's huge, it might be truncated.
             
             I will blindly try to implement based on standard Jimdo structure (WABE uses Jimdo).
             Class `j-module` and `j-text`. dates are usually in `strong`.
             
             Let's try to fetch it again, but this time, I will ask the subagent to return the TEXT content of the `cc-matrix` div, maybe that's smaller and fits?
             
             Or better: I will blindly implement the provider using `selenium` or `playwright` logic but I don't have those libraries installed? 
             No, I have to implement a `requests` based provider.
             
             The "browser_subagent" result is text. 
             
             Let's try to guess the structure from the snippet:
             `<div id="cc-m-..." class="j-module n j-text ">`
             
             I will create the file `wabe_browser_source.html` with a placeholder for now and implement the provider to read from the URL if possible (but we know it fails).
             
             Wait, the PROMPT said "Save the HTML content to a file named 'wabe_browser.html'... Also return the final URL".
             The subagent said "I have retrieved the HTML source below. The main agent can now save this content...".
             IT DID NOT SAVE IT because it didn't have the tool.
             
             I will try to use `browser_subagent` again but this time I will ask it to return the relevant textual information (date, title, link) directly as a JSON string, which is smaller and won't be truncated?
             
             Or I can ask it to use `execute_browser_javascript` to extract the data and return THAT.
